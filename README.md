# Welcome

- Made this page to upload some code which someone may (or may not) find useful 
- Interested in C++,python libraries, want to get going with some ML and AI (guess this point is my 'code' wishlist)
- Will appreciate any feedback/comments about any work I put up here
- Ways to contact me:
