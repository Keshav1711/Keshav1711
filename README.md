Greetings!

I am KyZEN, called Keshav IRL (but KyZEN ain't too bad either). I made this page to manage my projects and upload code which someone may (or may not) find useful.

I am currently a third year undergrad at IIT Bombay in the department of Electric Engineering. I am rather academically inclined and my research interests lie in the interdisciplinary fields that bring together aspects of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a (wannabe) researcher and not an avid coder. I enjoy writing code but I see it more as a means to an end.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback or comments on my work, so feel free to reach out to me with your thoughts. I am always eager to improve my skills and learn from others.

If you need to get in touch with me, you can reach me at either of the following email addresses: keshavsinghal2002@gmail.com or kyzen1711@gmail.com.

Thank you for coming to this remote corner of the internet. (I sure hope it doesn't always remain remote)
